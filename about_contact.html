          In case you couldn't already tell, I love to ramble, yap, and chat. If
          you want to talk mutual interests, old web stuff, development, or just
          want to exchange cool links... I would love to chat! I am also open to
          art trades and collaborative work. Just toss me an email and I will
          get back to you ASAP.

            It's a relatively small Tumblr-like community that is mainly used by
            "indie web" dwellers and developers. I prefer it to Mastodon and
            Fediverse communities because, in my opinion, Cohost has far more
            diverse communities and content. The
            <a href="https://antisoftware.club/">development company</a> that
            runs it seems pretty cool, too.

            is probably my favorite community spot on the Web right now. There
            are so many cool discussions and interesting things going on at all
            hours of the day (except for Mondays).
            <a href="https://melonking.net/" target="_blank">Melon</a> does a
            wonderful job of running it and the members are all so kind and
            open-minded. <b>Click the image above</b> to navigate to my forum

            love this concept and also how much freedom there is to customize
            your page with CSS. You can even embed a customizable widget inside
            your website! Mine is pasted on the edge of my site.
