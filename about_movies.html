      <p>
        <b class="italo">I absolutely love movies;</b> they're my favorite form
        of art over all others. I've seen thousands in my lifetime and am always
        adding to my personal collection of DVDs and VHS tapes. I love watching
        special features, listening to the commentary, and reading movies' IMDB
        and Wikipedia entries so that I can spout useless trivia to whoever will
        listen. I also keep a detailed spreadsheet of every movie my wife and I
        have ever watched together <i>(seriously)</i> and what we rated each one
        out of 5 stars. Below, you will find the first ten movies that I thought
        of when considering my favorite movies. I have many more favorites than
        these, but I chose ten to discipline myself and save you the bandwidth.

            <b>Genre(s):</b> Science Fiction, Cyberpunk, Anime
            <br />
            <b>Salty Says:</b> This movie is a masterclass in every facet of
            filmmaking. The story is brilliant, the atmosphere is absolutely
            haunting, the soundtrack and effects could not be more fitting, and
            the animation <i>(especially the color work)</i> is about as close
            as humanity will get to perfection.
            <b class="italo"><i>Go watch this; feel something.</i></b>
            Additionally, if you are a native English speaker, I would highly
            recommend watching the English dub of this movie. It far outweighs
            the original Japanese audio for me personally, mainly because my
            brain just doesn't pick up on the nuances of how Japanese speakers
            convey various emotions.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> If you thought Wes Andersen was whimsical then
            think again! Am√©lie takes the cake on the whole

            is an absolute delight. It's heartwarming, charming, and just
            grounded enough to feel real despite its many surreal elements.
            Unlike Akira, I would recommend watching this film with its original
            French audio dub. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a wonderful filmmaker, and I
            would also recommend his other movies from this era: "Delicatessen"
            and "The City of Lost Children."

            <b>Genre(s):</b> Slasher, Thriller
            <br />
            <b>Salty Says:</b> The general critical consensus is that this is
            one of Tarantino's worst films, but
            <b class="italo">I wholeheartedly disagree.</b> This movie is an
            excellent rework of the 1960s/70s "sexploitation" trope and a
            near-perfect homage to the iconic car chases spanning the whole of
            movies history. It is blaringly action-packed from start to finish.
            Kurt Russell absolutely steals the show with his performance, as
            does the excellent soundtrack. This is the ultimate girl power
            movie.

            is something so inherently charming about everything Simon Pegg and
            Nick Frost do. They have such great on-screen chemistry, and damn if
            this movie isn't <b class="italo">fucking hilarious</b>. I love the
            repeated bits and shots that Edgar Wright uses throughout the
            Cornetta Trilogy; this film is definitely the best out of the three.

            of Miyazaki's best. I used to put this on to go to sleep when I was
            a kid, and I still revisit it often. Howl's Moving Castle is a
            beautifully animated anti-war story that tugs your heartstrings the
            whole way through. If you are a native English speaker, I definitely
            recommend watching the Disney audio dub. Christian Bale nails the
            voice work for the titular character.

            <br />
            <b>Salty Says:</b> This silent film is definitely tied with "Akira"
            as my all-time favorite. A masterpiece of its era, "Metropolis"
            influenced just about every science fiction movie that came after
            it. The aesthetics of the movie are especially striking; there is a
            lot of obvious draw from Bauhaus and other similar art movements of
            the time period, and it just looks so good! I think the ending of
            the movie is pretty naive, but it's so cool to see such an early
            film <b class="italo">hit so hard</b> on class warfare and the
            perils of industrialism.

            <br />
            <b>Salty Says:</b> If silent films aren't really your thing, then I
            would recommend Rintaro's masterwork (loose) adaptation of the
            original Metropolis. It is far removed from the original film, as it
            is not a direct remake. I would argue that Metropolis is just as
            important as Akira; hell, it was even written by Katsuhiro Otomo,
            but I don't believe it got enough exposure to ever gain that status.
            It is just as dark, violent, and anti-capitalist as Akira.
            Metropolis is truly
            <b class="italo">the most beautiful movie I have ever seen</b>, and
            the ending scene makes me cry every time. So good!

            really nailed so many aspects of this movie, especially the Morales'
            family dynamic and all the characters' relationships. It is really
            nice to see a non-white-bro-dominated superhero movie done in a

            younger characters can overcome their problems. Miyazaki takes it a
            completely different route and shows the viewer that people can
