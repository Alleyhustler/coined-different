        <p>
          Holy shit I redid all the CSS on the site for the millionth time. Now
          that I do coding for a job, I actually have to be better at CSS
          instead of half-assing it, haha. I'm still working through the changes
          in class names on all the HTML pages, but goddamn the CSS ended up
          really nice for the iframe content. Take a look under the hood and
          there's notes for ya if you're interested in the methods (or lack
          thereof)..
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fr the <b>CSS</b> code looks way cleaner, animations are smoother,
            the code itself is far more efficient, and the whole 16 hour ordeal
            just makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Enjoy the
            slightly-different (but far superior) look!
          </li>
          <li>
            I rearranged all the widgets on the homepage and made the frame way
            bigger, so there's not so much space being wasted on the page. It's
            also easier to read and use!
          </li>
          <li>
            I redid all the CSS media queries, so the site should be far more
            functional on a phone/tablet/hi-res screen, but definitely not as
            cool looking and you should still only look at it if you're on a
            desktop PC at 1080p (preferably using Firefox or an open-source
            browser) üòâ
          </li>
          <li>
            I also added more adoptables to the
            <a href="adopt.html">adopt</a> page, again.
          </li>

        <p>A here and there update...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added some more adoptees to my
            <a href="adopt.html">Adoptables</a> page.
          </li>
          <li>
            I cleaned up some sloppy code (and writing) on the
            <a href="art.html">Art</a> page. I updated and added some links in
            the <b>music</b>
            section, as well.

        <p>
          Still going through and fixing some bonked up CSS from my big overhaul
          a couple months ago. It's been on the backburner, but I'm nearly
          through with it. The <a href="updates.html">Site Updates</a> page was
          kinda broken, as well, so I fixed that.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Added an <a href="adopt.html">Adoptables</a> page. I have a lot
            more to add, but I at least got a folder in there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lots of CSS tweaking. Too much, maybe. I feel like a fr tweaker.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjusted the landing page. I really hated the buttons I drew; now
            they're just normal HTML/CSS buttons. Enjoy!

        <p>
          So I've been hoarding updates for months now... I'm not even gonna try
          to sum up all the changes I've made because I've been bad at my
          documentation. The summer heat has killed all my brain cells, but I
          still made some cool changes to the site. There's a landing page now;
          not sure I really like it too much, but it's there because I wanted to
          put a non-responsive/content warning up front. It might change again
          soon, not really sure. Lots of changes here though, have a click
          around!

          Yooo I forgot that I let the old graphics site domain name expire.. so
          I bought a new one, fixed my web server's Apache config, and re-setup
          ABBA! Sorry to all who have tried to visit my .gif collection and
          gotten a "host not found" error. Sometimes I'm a little lazy with my
          IT rituals at home since I do them for a job, as well. üò¨

        <p>
          I guess I accidentally broke some older pages on the site, especially
          those filed under the <b>About</b> page. Whoops! I am working on
          fixing them, and just revamped the
          <a href="about_games.html">favorite video games</a> page. I also
          kicked out Diablo 2 as a favorite... for now.

        <p>Tiny update today:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I added a cool drum loop that I recently unearthed to my
            <a href="art_music.html">one-offs</a> music page!
          </li>
          <li>
            I also added a new
            <a href="blog_tinymusic.html">tiny music critique</a>.

        <h3>JUL.20.2024</h3>
        <p>
          I went <b>sicko mode</b> and redid the whole site's CSS. I seriously
          worked on this for like 8 straight hours, but god the code is
          beautiful and the site looks so much better:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I also improved my CSS animations, aggregated all the classes, and
            slightly improved mobile responsiveness.
          </li>
          <li>
            I added a couple of new neighbors to the site buttons article on the
            <a href="misc.html">Miscellanea</a>
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            I reworked the <a href="about.html">about me</a> page and its
            subarticles. The sub-pages are still a work in progress, but it's
            looking really good!
          </li>
          <li>
            I rearranged the chat box, status cafe, and navbar so they're less
            ugly to look at. I also added a new site background, which is just a
            dithered version of some Fallout: New Vegas concept art.
          </li>

        <p>
          üëã I spent a lot of time drawing this week on the wife's trusty iPad.
          I added lots of cool new drawn assets to spice up the look of the
          site:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I drew a <b>new self-portrait</b> for the
            <a href="main.html">landing</a> page. The cute little doll I had
            before was not mine, so it didn't feel right to have it on the page
            (I do still have the old image credited on the
            <a href="credits.html">site credits</a> page. I really like how it
            turned out; I really do look like that lol üö∫
          </li>
          <li>
            I also made a <b>1080p desktop wallpaper</b>; you can find it on the
            <a href="misc.html">Miscellanea</a>
            page! üë©‚Äçüé®
          </li>
          <li>
            I rearranged the widgets around the site's main frame to accommodate
            a widget honoring my wife. Eventually, it will link to her homepage,
            which I made for her last summer. üë≠

        <h3>JUL.11.2024</h3>
        <p>
          üëã Long time no see! I've finally gotten over whatever weird issue
          I've had with avoiding editing the site, so here a few new things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I've added a new article to the
            <a href="misc.html">Miscellanea</a> page.
          </li>
          <li>
            I've finally added a few of the songs that I've made to the
            <a href="art_music.html">Salty's Tunes</a>
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also switched over to <b>ATABook</b> for a replacement
            <a href="https://saltedslug.atabook.org/">guestbook</a> after
            123Guestbook.com shut down. :-(
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>As always,</b> I have a ton of things in the works, so I don't plan
          to go dark for three months again. See y'all soon! :)

          <b>much faster</b> than before. Finally, I added a small article of
          CSS to make the site look better on
          <b>hi-res gamer edition screens</b> (greater than 1080p). Enjoy. :)

        <p>
          ‚ú® Today I introduced my new site layout, <b>Slug 3.0</b>. This change
          is best experienced with your eyes, as my previous layout looked
          completely different. I also restructured the site map and navigation,
          consolidated and added .html pages, and poured a whole lot more love
          into a total revision of the site's code and features. There are still
          a few pages from the original site that I haven't migrated yet, but
          keep an eye out in the coming days for more updates!

          code) for awhile now, and I hope to have it done within the coming
          months. I have been busy with a new job and recording music, but I did
          finally make an
          <b>88x31 button</b> for my site. You'll find it on the

          it's a nice little scroll if you wanna know what bands I like the

          <a href="art_digital.html">Digital Art</a> pages. The HTML code is new

        <p>
          I have been working hard on what feels like a million different
          projects. I've made a few more websites since updating this one, and I
          have also been busy making new music and art. However... I have found
          the time to completely remake the site from scratch!
          <b>Salty Slug 2.0</b> is far more responsive and well-written
          code-wise, and I am very pleased with how it has evolved. I hope you
          guys like it. :)

          <a href="art_3d.html">3D art</a> and
          <a href="art_digital.html">digital art</a>. I hope y'all like
          browsing!

          I started on my <a href="credits.html">Site Credits</a> page and added
          a few of the resources that I've used for the site. This one's still a
          work in progress. I also added a cursor to the site, nothing fancy,
          just Gary. üêå

          I added a bunch of my <b>stupid internet art</b> to the *NEW*
          <a href="art_web.html">Internet Art</a> page. If you love Kidpix and
          2000s Barbie games don't miss this one! I added a new collage as well.

          I finished the landing for my <b>*NEW*</b>
          <a href="art.html">Art & Music</a> page. I also started on a article
          for my favorite movies, did some CSS tweaking, and general site
          maintenance.

        <p>
          I added a variety of my newest hyperfixations to my
          <a href="about.html">About</a> page with lots of fun dropdowns and
          emojis. Check it out! I also tweaked the sidebar to look much better
          and less stressful.

        <h3>DEC.22.2022</h3>
        <p>
          This is the date I initially published the site after working on it
          for a couple of weeks. I have since redone the styling after putting a
          few more weeks of learning CSS in my back pocket.
