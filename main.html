          This isn‚Äôt a memecoin that came from a trend. It‚Äôs the trend.  
          <br /><br />
          <b>Coined Different</b> ($DIFF) exists in rejection of replicas, forks, and noise.  
          It's not just a coin‚Äîit's a message:  
          <i>we don't follow narratives, we coin them.</i>
          <br /><br />
          Born from silence, $DIFF isn't hyped, shilled, or dressed in emoji.  
          It is the coin that coined itself. No roadmap. No false promises. No empty pump.  
          Just presence. Just purpose. Just difference.
          <br /><br />
          **Tagline:** <b>Not made. Not minted. Coined.</b>
          <br /><br />
          **Lore:** Before the mass replication era, before memecoins became templates,  
          there was $DIFF. A single rupture in the repetition. The concept of origin.  
          A coin that refused conformity and chose sovereignty.  
          <br /><br />
          You don‚Äôt trade $DIFF. You recognize it.  
          <br /><br />
          If you're still looking for a meme, you're late.  
          This is already language.

          <b>Coined Different launches.</b> No hype. No presale. No roadmap.  
          Just one line of code, written to disrupt the cycle.  
          This isn't a mirror of the past‚Äîit's the origin of new difference.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The site has been aligned with the minimalist, sovereign ethos of $DIFF. Expect less. Value more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Removed fluff, noise, and trend-chasing content. Purged for precision.
          </li>
          <li>
            Core messaging deployed across all surface layers. If you know, you know.

            The true holders don‚Äôt need a pitch. They already felt it.
