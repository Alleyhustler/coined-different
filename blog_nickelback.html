        ü™® I drove all the way to Tulsa, Oklahoma to see
        <b>a goddamn rock'n'roll show</b>, and I'll be damned if Nickelback
        didn't serve up a fat helping of rock AND roll for this Midwest dyke to
        enjoy!!!!!! <br /><br />
        I know a lot of folks don't take their music seriously, but they play
        stadium shows for a reason... just saying. So my wife and I decided to
        buy tickets because they weren't really that pricey, and it sounded like
        a fun time whether they were good or bad. So we hopped in the car and on
        down to Oklahoma. My immediate first thought hearing them play was that
        they had a pretty damn good sound team. It's hard to make their type of
        music sound good in any space, especially a
        <b>big ass fuckin' hockey stadium</b>, even when you've been playing
        together and gear experimenting for 30 years. So good for them. I also
        loved that they brought a fan onstage to sing a duet of "Rockstar" with
        Chad, which was definitely not as painful as you might think. The lanky
        little yeehaw dude they picked was awesome and he really slayed it,
        albeit he'd had about a dozen too many Coors Lights and damn near fell
        off the stage..

        Aside from the music ripping hard, <b>the visuals</b> accompanying the
        songs were really cool to look at, as well. They were different for each
        song, and honestly, the art style and rendering were executed really
        well. They must hand pick a lot of their employees or something, or
        their record company is just really good at hiring little queers to do
        the music production.. I also thought it was perfect "beer dad humor"
        that they had red and blue lighting for their rendition of Chad's finest
        work,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vuw8SRDNEDI" target="_blank"
          >"Hero"</a

        for the <i>Spider-Man (2002)</i> soundtrack.

      <br />
      <p>
        <b class="italo">*My only caveat</b> to my "5 star" rating was the
        opener, üëéBrantley Gilbert.üëé I don't know what hick-hop hellhole they
        pulled that guy out of, but while he was playing I felt like I was at an
        alt-right church service. His band was louder than Nickelback, which if
        I were Nickelback, I'd be a little bit upset about. Their sound was also
        mixed terribly, which was probably on purpose so the sound guy didn't
        have to hear this shit. You couldn't hear anything but the faux Kirk
        Hammett guitar soloist the entire time, and I could barely distinguish
        between the different songs. <br /><br />
        You'd think <b>thrash metal guitar featuring Fred Durst</b>
        <i
          >(if he had less stage presence and was country artist from the Deep
          South -- I'm looking at you, Kid Rock)</i
        >
        would be pretty entertaining, but it turns out that the charm wears off
        after about 30 seconds. Suddenly you realize, even though you're wearing
        expensive ear plugs and are sitting in front of a million dollar sound
        system run by industry professionals, your ears are somehow still
        ringing. At least Kid Rock has some good songs, and you can probably
        hear him singing at his concerts. I try to be non-judgmental about music
        because I know it's hard to perform your art in front of a bunch of
        people, but I simply did not get the hype. A lot of other folks around
        me looked confused or bored when üö´Mr. Gilbertüö´ started his act, as
        well. I just don't understand why he got picked out of all the possible
        bands they could've hired. It just felt like an out-of-place choice, and
        it definitely didn't hype me up to see some <b>goddamn rock'n'roll</b>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Despite my qualms, I still think Nickelback put on a hell of a show
        that was worth the price of admission. They shredded every single riff,
        they played all their popular singles and it sounded better than the
        studio recordings, and their visual show and stage banter was
        entertaining as hell without being cringy. Just be prepared to suffer
        through the opener if you're not into the whole
        <i>"Florida Georgia Line if they got into QAnon"</i> shtick.
