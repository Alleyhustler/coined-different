          <b class="italo">I love making collages;</b> they've always been my
          favorite way to express an idea. I have not scanned most of the
          collages I've made and, unfortunately, the majority of the ones that I
          made between 2015-2020 were in a portfolio that was lost in the mail
          and never found. The ones I do have left from that era, as well as my
          newer works, are listed below.

          This is a collage that I made by scanning a bunch of ~1960s ephemera
          lying around my house onto my computer and stitching it together using
          Photoshop, then I slapped an old picture of me on top of it all.

          I made this collage by making photocopies of some images from a 1960s
          Playboy magazine and this really cool, old "Woman of the Year" button
          the wife and I found at a thrift store. I also used a few stamps and
          miscellaneous scraps of paper from a random craft pile. Aren't women
          so amazing?

          This is a digital collage I made to accompany a deep house song I made
          a couple years ago. I mainly used assets sourced from my favorite
          online archive,
          <a href="https://oneletterwords.com/weblog">OneLetterWords.</a>
          Craig uploads the most interesting materials and categorizes them in
          such a pleasing way!

          I made this collage using a shitty black & white copier and some
          masking tape at one of my old jobs. I made a bunch of copies and gave
          them to all of my friends. It's simple but one of my favorites; the
          Sims plumbob is the best part.

          This is a quick 10 minute collage I threw together at a local art
          museum's creative space. They had a bunch of prints of various
          artworks in the museum that you could cut up and glue onto a notecard.
          The woman with the fish has always been one of my favorite paintings
          at this particular museum, so I was really excited that it was one of
          the options.

          I made this
          <i>(extremely uplifting)</i> collage during a workshop that my
          girlfriend and I attended. The artist who ran the workshop,
          <a href="https://linktr.ee/stayclosetay">Tay Butler</a>, is an
          incredibly talented artist. I would highly recommend checking out his
          works, especially his video collages.

          This is my favorite collage that I've ever made. It's pretty big
          <i>(3 letter-sized pages taped together)</i> and is an "interpret it
          how you would like" statement on the church and lesbianism. I cut all
          the images out of old magazines from the '50s and '60s; the only
          criteria for making it was that everything had to be black-and-white.

          I found this in a notepad from a boring desk job I had long ago. I
          don't like to go too insane with every collage that I make, so I like
          that this one is cartoony and more "fun" than some of my other ones.

          This was a fun one. I used my Xbox game manual for

          pictures. Also fuck Steve Jobs! :)

          I made this collage after I broke up with my first (and only)
          boyfriend. I thought I was pretty sly using the ripped up Mac Demarco
          j-card for this one. I, of course, angrily ripped it up for some
          reason during the course of our relationship. Thank god I'm a lesbian!

          I've always loved mid-century design AND women, so this is a perfect
          early culmination of those interests. Cool colors too! I'm pretty sure
          I ripped these from a Reader's Digest magazine.

          I think this is the first collage that I ever finished; before I was a
          teenager, I mostly just played the guitar and did pencil-based
          drawings. I made this as a present for my mom's birthday because she
          loves Wes Anderson and whimsical shit in general. I think she still
          has the physical copy stashed away somewhere.
