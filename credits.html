        On this page, you'll find a semi-comprehensive list of the resources
        that I utilize to develop this website. I have tried to categorize them
        in a way that makes sense. Let me know if any of the links are ever
        broken and I will get those fixed. This page is
        <b>under construction</b>, as I have a lot more resources than this, but
        I haven't quite gotten around to compiling them all. Check back later
        for more!

        <p>
          ‚ñ∏ The graffiti font on the landing page is called
          <b>Felipe Segundo</b>. I feel like most graffiti fonts are not very
          good, but this one translated really well to the style of my site. You
          can download it from
          <a href="http://www.woodcutter.es/" target="_blank">Woodcutter</a>.
          <br />
          <br />
          ‚ñ∏ The bitmap font used in the site headings and buttons is called
          <b>04b_03b</b> and may be downloaded from
          <a href="https://www.dafont.com/04b-03b.font">dafont.com</a>. The
          author is Yuji Oshimoto, whose
          <a href="http://www.04.jp.org/">portfolio</a> is incredibly iconic and
          worth digging through. This font and its lookalikes were all over
          forum signatures back in the 2000s! <br /><br />
          ‚ñ∏ The font that you are reading is called
          <b>SH Pinscher Regular</b>. Tinghao Hu authored this incredible font;
          you may download it from their
          <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/users/sayshu/">1001Fonts</a>
          profile. My site would honestly be boring and ugly without this font.
          It is just so well done and easy to read at small point sizes, which
          is definitely not the case for TRUE bitmap fonts (especially the one
          above). It even has some emojis and other special characters built in!

        <h3 class="flex-pad left-align-text">üñºÔ∏è Images</h3>
        <p>
          ‚ñ∏ I obtain most of the <b>animated .gifs</b> on the site from
          <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a>, which is a
          filename-based .gif search engine provided by the
          <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>. You can scroll
          this bad boy for hours and never run out of unhinged images to harvest
          from other (usually long-dead) personal websites. I recommend clicking
          the images in the search results; if you do, then you'll be taken to
          an archival snapshot of the site where it found the image. It's also a
          fun scroll to share with friends! <br /><br />
          ‚ñ∏ The site background is concept art from Fallout: New Vegas that I
          dithered using <a href="https://ditherit.com/">DitherIt</a>, which is a
          fantastic web-based dithering tool. <br /><br />
          ‚ñ∏ Anything else you see is likely my own art that I drew on the wife's
          iPad in Procreate. It's a fun little thing that really got me into
          drawing for the first time in almost a decade.

        <p>
          ‚ñ∏ I utilize the free version of
          <a href="https://www.cbox.ws/">Cbox</a> for the <b>chatroom</b> that
          is embedded into Salty's Lair. The free version is nice, but I wish
          it'd let you change the CSS without paying for the service. I might
          switch away from this eventually. <br /><br />
          ‚ñ∏ The goofy animated <b>Surf Club</b> embeddable next to the chatbox
          will take you to the Surf Club webring navigator (if you click the
          outer<b>"Warp Zone"</b> ring) to see other member sites in the
          <a href="https://melonland.net/surf-club">Melonland Surf Club</a>. If
          you get bored of Salty's Lair, I would definitely check this out!
          <br /><br />
          ‚ñ∏ I use <b>Status.Cafe</b> to embed my most recent update (that you
          see at the bottom-left portion of the site) from my
          <a href="https://status.cafe/users/saltedslug">site profile</a>.

          <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/">Cloud Convert</a> üî∏
          <b>Font File Conversion</b>
          <br />
          I use this site to convert .TTF and .OTF files to web-compatible .WOFF
          and .WOFF2 files. I try not to use these gimmicky conversion websites
          when I can avoid it, but sometimes it's worth saving the headache of
          doing it yourself.

          <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> üî∏
          <b>Code Testing & Sharing</b>
          <br />
          I occasionally use CodePen for testing out development ideas without
          breaking my projects. This "social media-slash-web-development" site
          allows you to edit and preview HTML, CSS, and JS all in one window
          (and in real time), but with the added benefit that it doesn't make
          your eyes bleed. It's also a good way to find new CSS tricks and
          inspiration from other users!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <a href="https://emojicopy.com/">EmojiCopy</a> üî∏
          <b>Copying Emoticons to the Clipboard</b>
          <br />
          I use this to copy-paste the emoticons you see all over my website
          into my code editor. I use this site over the many "emoji selector"
          copycats because they have a search engine that is actually
          functional, which saves me a lot of time. Yes, modern emojis aren't
          very 2000s but I love them and they're so fun! Plus, they look cool
          with my glowy, scanline overlay.

          ‚≠ê <a href="https://ezgif.org/">Ezgif</a> üî∏
          <b>The WebDev Swiss Army Knife</b> ‚≠ê
          <br />
          If I could only choose one "indie webdev" tool, it would be Ezgif.
          This is the holy grail of image conversion and optimization web tools.
          It translates between common image file types. It crops, compresses,
          rotates, resizes, and optimizes .gifs. You can even MAKE a .gif out of
          a stack of pictures, which is not the most straightforward thing to do
          offline if you don't have a good handle on Photoshop/GIMP. It isn't
          updated too frequently, but it already has a ton of features that work
          REALLY well. What more can you ask for out of a free tool?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <a href="https://fsymbols.com/">Fsymbols</a> üî∏
          <b>Copying Glyphs/Symbols to the Clipboard</b>
          <br />
          This serves a similar to EmojiCopy, but I use this one for ALT code
          symbols and other non-emoji symbols. They also provide an "emoji copy"
          feature but navigating it gives me a headache. You'll see what I mean.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.remove.bg/">Remove.bg</a> üî∏
          <b>Image Background Removal</b>
          <br />
          This site just removes plain backgrounds from an image. I have no idea
          what they do with my data, and I probably don't want to know, but
          that's the trade-off I suppose. It works pretty well, so I use it
          (sparingly) when I am away from home and can't use GIMP or Photoshop.
          I wouldn't recommend feeding your personal photos it, however. :)

          <a href="https://gifrun.com/">GifRun</a> üî∏
          <b>Convert Youtube Clips to .gifs</b>
          <br />
          Downloading a Youtube video, editing it, and converting it into a .gif
          is a pain in the ass and a big time suck no matter which way you look
          at it. If you survived the Tumblr fandom wars of '14, then you have
          probably cried over the .gif creation process. This site takes
          whatever Youtube URL you feed into it and gives you a simple tool to
          convert it into a .gif, albeit with a hideous and slightly confusing
          UI. I've tried a couple of similar online services but they were much
          more limited with their freemium features.

        <h2>üìö Learning Resources üìö</h2>
        <p>
          I work in IT, so I usually cut my teeth on new software and languages
          by reading the boring vendor documentation and one supplementary "fun"
          source. My apologies in advance to all my video tutorial watchers, but
          that stuff doesn't work for me most of the time! I learned all I know
          through the following sites and the occasional "Stack Overflow"
          search:

        <p>
          The Mozilla Developer Network documentation is THE webdev [insert
          religious text of choice here]. They are on the cutting edge of
          standards and their documentation is beautifully-written and concise.
          If you can make it through the technical reading, there is no better
          way to figure out the proper way to code a webpage.

        üéì <a href="https://w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>
        <p>
          This is the go-to website for most budding front-end developers from
          what I have gathered. Their tutorials are easy to navigate and
          understand, and they're taught in a pretty effective order. I think
          they're a bit behind on coding best practices, especially with some of
          their CSS methods, but the functionality is definitely there even if
          not always the most efficient way to do something.

        <p>
          VSCodium is an open-source binary version of Microsoft's ever-popular
          VSCode code editor. I have tried many other alternatives, but I always
          come back to this one. It really is powerful, to Microsoft's credit,
          but I will avoid their telemetry at all costs. I use the following
          extensions (and their corresponding publisher) in my install:
        </p>
