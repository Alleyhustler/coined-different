          <b>This is my newest learned medium of art</b>. I make these collages
          in their own HTML page with inline positioning. There's no CSS or
          JavaScript. I harvest the .gifs from old web archives like
          <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a>. I really think these
          look so cool and have a lot of potential. I have been spending the
          past few months perfecting these, and I am currently working on one
          that (I think) is the best art piece I have ever created. I hope to
          have it finished sometime soon. <br /><br />
          Eventually, you'll be able to see the actual .HTML page and
          accompanying code for each collage. For now, I have just made .gifs
          out of the web pages. I'd love to hear feedback on these, as I am
          extremely proud of them! <b>Click any of the collage titles</b> to
          view the collage at full resolution in a new tab.
