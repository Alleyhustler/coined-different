        <!-- Introduction -->
        <p>
          This is the landing page for all the
          <b>technomancer-related things</b> on my website. I am constantly
          collecting old electronics, hoarding computers, and trying out
          software. I figure the best place to yammer about all of my cool tech
          stuff, aside from when I can trick my wife into listening to me talk
          about it, is on my website! This page will eventually hold all the
          things you see detailed below; most links are not functional
          <b>yet</b>.

          I have always loved collecting physical media, especially
          <b>the almighty CD-ROM</b>. It's nice to actually <i>own</i> software
          and music in an era plagued with streaming services and digital
          licenses. I especially like to swipe up mystery CDs from thrift stores
          that contain shareware, clip art graphics collections, or retro PC
          games. This link will take you to my Internet Archive profile where
          you may download anything from my collection!

        <p>
          I have a ton of "old" tech that I've been accumulating over the years.
          My collection includes digital cameras, camcorders, computers, TVs,
          and other oddball electronics that I scavenge. Eventually, this will
          be a complete archive of the collection featuring pictures of and
          write-ups about each item, as well as any cool projects I've done with
          them.

          In case you missed it, I'm a big fan of computers. Naturally, I have
          been slowly perfecting my PC setup for many years with a suite of
          custom scripts, software, and other software debauchery. Learn about
          all that stuff and maybe also someday play with the stickers and
          magnets on a virtual copy of my computer case! :)

        <p>
          As a kid, I loved harvesting extra content like icon sets and desktop
          wallpapers that you could get from inserting PC games, CDs, and
          DVD-ROMs into a computer. Luckily, I've always been pretty responsible
          with my digital data, so most of that stuff has been carried over to
          every new computer I've had since I was 8 or 9. I will upload these to
          the site someday soon.

          I would love to collect all my goofy avatars from my experiences in
          online gaming over the last 20 years. You know: Neopets, Runescape,
          AdventureQuest, that sort of thing. Many of the sites I used are long
          dead, but you never know what I may find on an old flash drive
          someday!
