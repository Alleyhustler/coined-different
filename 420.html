          Like waking from a dream gone on too long, you suddenly gain
          conciousness and find yourself driving down <i>Highway 420.</i> You
          feel a little bit paranoid, but you're enjoying the night breeze
          whistling through cracked windows...

          Just as the paranoia feels as though it may subside, you're blinded by
          a pair of headlights in your rearview mirror. You slam the mirror to
          one side, yet all you see is bright white light. Milliseconds pass,
          and you feel as though you'll never see again, but enough of your
          vision returns just in time to swerve out of the way of a
          <i>opossum</i>. You slam on the brakes and pull to the side of the
          road. The car that appeared only a few feet behind you just moments
          ago is nowhere to be seen.

          Your nerves get the best of you and start to wonder,
          <b>"What if they come back?"</b> Sweat forms at your brow. A gnawing
          fear has lodged itself firmly in your thoughts and you anxiously scan
          the horizon for the next exit.
          <b>"It has to be in the next mile or two..."</b> Your foot presses
          harder on the gas pedal.
