        <b class="italo"> üèÜ Salty's Top 10 Artists üèÜ </b>
        I cannot convey to y'all how hard it was to dial this down to 10 bands
        for length's sake... I ingest an unhealthy amount of music every year.
        I've written a little blurb about each artist on the list, as well as my
        personal choice of the artist's best album. I also listed my three
        favorite songs
        <i>(including links to the music video or a live performance)</i>
        from each artist if you want to give them a listen!

            <b>Salty Says:</b> If you don't know ABBA, then I guess you've been
            living under a rock. I mean, come on, it's ABBA. But seriously, I
            truly believe ABBA is the greatest pop band of all time. They did
            some amazing stuff recording- and production-wise in a pretty
            infantile time for synthesizers and electronic music in general.
            Their production masterpiece is a track called, "My Mama Said."
            Their live recordings are pretty damn good too for how demanding
            some of their songs are to perform.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> I never understood the whole "Beach Boys versus
            The Beatles" thing that happens in critics' circles, really. They
            are totally different bands with different artistic goals, so if
            you've been turned away from them because of that, I would highly
            recommend giving them another try. Brian Wilson devised monolithic,
            beautiful soundscapes and truly mastered music production in his
            era. Pet Sounds is my favorite album of all time; I never get tired
            of listening to it front-to-back. However, I do also love their
            goofy "Top 40" surf pop, too. Even the Christmas album is good, and
            I hate Christmas, damn it!

            <b>Salty Says:</b> Broncho is my favorite band of all time. They are
            criminally underrated and often only examined by their TV commercial
            song, "Class Historian." Don't get me wrong, that song is great and
            I'm glad it gives them some royalty income, but it does their
            artistic growth since 2010 a huge disservice. There is just
            something about their music that deeply resonates with me and just
            shatters my soul with each listen. I have seen Broncho many times
            live, chatted with them about their process, and am simply enamored
            by everything that they do. Double Vanity is tied with Pet Sounds
            for my favorite album of all time, but all of their albums are truly
            great. Ryan writes the most beautiful, haunting songs that I've ever
            heard in my life.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> I listen to a lot of trap and pluggnB, and Don
            Toliver is the most refreshing artist I've heard come out of the
            genre in a long ass time. He has such a great voice and he commands
            AutoTune better than the genre's pioneers. He writes the most
            beautiful vocal melodies, and I have loved every project he's done
            since I heard his "Donny Womack" mixtape back in 2018. If you like
            modern trap coupled with some snazzy, slick ass vocal melodies, then
            Don is your man. Also, his new album "Hardstone Psycho" is really
            good.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> Green Day is the first band I ever loved. They
            taught me how to play the guitar, how to write a song, and how
            artists don't have to fit in one little box and stay there. Despite
            how you may feel about "pop punk" and that whole can of worms, we
            all have to give Green Day credit for initiating a huge movement of
            bringing punk sentiments to the mainstream and exposing a ton of
            people to their "true punk" influences. Nimrod absolutely blew my
            mind when I heard it for the first time, moreso than Dookie or
            Insomniac. It just felt so envelope-pushing and far out for a
            coked-out, queer punk band to produce. I really enjoy every single
            album up to 21st Century Breakdown, but anything after that is not
            really worth your time. I can't believe these bastards have been
            putting on shows since the '80s.. I saw them about a decade ago and
            they played for three hours straight; it was fucking awesome.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> The Chicks <i>(formerly the Dixie Chicks)</i> are
            the most punk band to come out of the States since, well, forever.
            They have always been personally outspoken against assholes, and
            they are confident and masterful in their artistry despite working
            in a male-dominated, conservative genre. They are STILL banned from
            country radio because of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Chicks_controversy"
              >the incident</a
            >
            that happened in the early 2000s, but they continue to sell out
            shows across the world and are one of the best live bands,
            personally, that I've ever witnessed. There would be no Miranda
            Lambert or Taylor Swift without The Chicks. They are by far the best
            "country pop" act of the '90s and '00s, and their first two albums
            are solid all the way through. My personal favorite is their
            bluegrass masterpiece, "Home." Six-year-old me also thought Emily,
            the banjo player, was soooo hot.

            Don't let his McDonald's meal and Fortnite concert fool you: this
            man means business when it comes to setting trajectories for what
            modern hip-hop sounds like. I love every single album he's released
            since Rodeo, and his mixtapes before that were good, too. I love his
            post-Kanye acid-trip take on modern trap. He's not afraid to use
            whatever whacky ass synth sound Mike Dean comes up with, and he's
            good at picking features. Despite his controversies and countless
            cash grabs
            <i
              >(all billionaires are complete psychopaths; he is no
              exception)</i

            of my favorite albums of all time, front-to-back.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> Wavves were such a great band to come out of the
            "pop-punk" answer to the whole Burger Records/DIY era of lofi rock
            coming out in the early 2010s. Their first couple releases are
            extremely blown out and lo-fi, but don't let that fool you. They
            really came into their own and recorded an absolute classic
            "post-tumblr stoner kid" album, "King of the Beach." If you like
            snotty, self-deprecating pop punk then Wavves is the band for you.
            "Afraid of Heights" is my favorite record from them; it is a lot
            more grunge and a big step up in production quality. Their newest
            records are also really good and deserve a listen. They're also a
            great live band; I've seen them 5 or 6 times at this point.

      Below I've include a number of my favorite albums. These are easy no-skips for me even though the band in
      question may or may not be considered a personal favorite. Hover over any of the album covers to see more
      information about them.

      I gathered these album covers using <a href="https://covers.musichoarders.xyz/">this</a> website and
      resized/optimized them using my favorite web-based tool, <a href="https://ezgif.com/">EZgif</a>.
