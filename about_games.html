        <b class="italo">Yeehaw, I love video games!</b> Don't we all? They've
        always been a healthy way for me to decompress and chill out throughout
        my entire life. This list includes the games that really stuck with me
        the most and a little blurb about why I love them so much. I also
        include when the game released, on which platform I played it, and
        applicable genre(s).

            <br />
            <b>Salty Says:</b> This is one of those games that makes me revert
            to that <i>"they don't make 'em like they used to"</i> old person
            mentality. This is my favorite game of all time, and I think it is
            the greatest RPG of all time. Everything about this game is perfect:
            the story, the characters, the soundtrack, the gameplay itself..
            it's all so thoughtful and realistic. It puts the writing of every
            single Star Wars movie and show to shame. If you haven't played this
            then you are missing out.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> This is the first Fallout that I ever played way
            back in the early 2000s, and it's the first I ever truly fell in
            love with. It is timeless, beautifully written, and it is a complete
            masterpiece of the genre. The atmosphere in this game is unmatched,
            and it has an incredible soundtrack. Those talking heads were just
            so mind-blowing!

            <b>Release Year:</b> 2015

            <b>Genre(s):</b>
            First person linear RPG, Zombie Survival, Parkour
            <br />
            <b>Salty Says:</b> Dying Light is an amazing game. I feel like a lot
            of mid 2010s games were pretty lackluster, especially the
            survival-oriented ones. However, this game absolutely
            <b>melted my face off</b> when I played it in college. I stayed up
            for two days straight playing it in between classes, and then I beat
            it again with one of my online friends a few weeks later. I still
            revisit it from time to time, and it never gets old. The gameplay
            and controls are still some of the most satisfying and immersive of
            any game that I've played. The city in the game, Haran, feels so
            real and isolating. The devs and sound teams really nailed the
            atmosphere; it absolutely sells the whole thing. The graphics still
            hold up, too! I can't recommend this one enough.

            This is the best survival game of all time. While maybe not the most
            visually striking, PZ has some <i>crazy</i> depth to its gameplay
            systems, especially when you factor in the countless combinations of
            mods that are available. It's been in active development for over a
            decade at this point, and it still has a sizeable and highly
            dedicated community. It's also insanely fun to play with friends,
            and I have spent hundreds of hours scavenging, surviving, and
            painfully dying on a handful of lovingly-maintained multiplayer
            servers.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> Folks outside of America know this one as, "Theme
            Park World" or "Theme Park 2". I have always loved management games,
            but this game is what began and shaped that love when I was very,
            very young. While originally marketed towards kids, this game does
            have a decent construction and management system for its time. I
            still revisit Sim Theme Park from time to time and have a blast
            doing so! The advisor "Bugsy" is annoying yet endearing, and I love
            him for that.

            <b>Salty Says:</b> I know a lot of you out there would die on the
            hill that MGS is the best stealth series of all time... but I really
            think Chaos Theory puts all of the Metal Gear games to shame as
            individual titles. This game was absolutely
            <b class="italo">mind-boggling</b>, both from a graphics and
            gameplay standpoint, when it released in '05, and having played it
            within the last couple years, it still holds up. The levels are
            amazing, the A.I. isn't <i>that</i> stupid, and the skill
            progression is natural and fluid. It's also got a really great co-op
            campaign that is separate from the single player storyline. It just
            <i>feels so good</i> to play this game. <br /><br /><i

              is also my favorite video game soundtrack of all time; if you're a
              fan of heavier industrial EDM and DNB then I would definitely
              recommend giving it a listen whether you like stealth games or
              not.</i

            Not only is this game insanely fun to play, it also has a

              >bangin' soundtrack</a
            >, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. The levels are
            well-designed, it's accessible to a lot of skill levels, and getting
            to skate as Darth Maul with his lightsaber is a definite bonus. I
            also think THPS3 did a good job of capturing the ethos and antics of
            mainstream skateboarding at the time.
