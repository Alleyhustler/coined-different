          In 2023, I developed a new intention of making
          <b>"Internet art."</b> I consider this to be goofy, inner-child type
          works that are made in old abandonware software from the late '90s and
          early '00s. My ethos is that every piece of software can be a formal
          art program if you have low enough standards and minimal ego. :) I
          have linked every program I used for these works below; all of them
          are free to use or abandonware.
