        Below is a handful of tracks that I've written, recorded, and produced.
        Some of the songs aren't properly mixed or mastered, but oh well. I'm
        more of an idea guy anyways! üòâ I am self-taught in Ableton, but I
        didn't learn to properly produce/record my own music until a few years
        ago, so a lot of my old songs are lost to time and only exist in my
        memory.

            This is a really cool drum'n'bass loop that I made at the beginning
            of 2024. All of the drums are chopped from one short sample, but I
            wanted to make every bar unique, so it sounds pretty crazy. The
            mixing is really good, too. I made the synth sounds myself in
            <b class="italo">Vital</b>. The goofy-sounding bitcrushed audio
            sample is from a Lady Gaga interview

            My wife tells me I should be happy with my art, but I disagree.
            However, she's almost always right, so I made this song in 2023 with
            the goal of finishing a song and being happy with it. I think it's
            some of my best work.
            <b>The samples used</b> in this song are from these games: Splinter
            Cell: Chaos Theory, Arcanum: of Steamworks & Magick Obscura, and
            Runescape. For the very cool, super shimmery convolution reverb, I
            used the
            <a href="shirobon.bandcamp.com/album/ps1-reve%c3%a2%c2%80%c2%a6ulse-responses.html"
              >PS1 impulse response</a
            >
            pack from <b>Shirobon</b>. The synths were all custom presets I made
            in Vital. The toy drum loops were chopped from a free
            <a href="audiokitpro.com/free-toy-casio-loops/index.html"

            This is a really dumb EDM remix that I made in 2021. It uses vocal
            samples from Cali Cartier's (shoutout STL, midwest represent) song

            from their masterpiece record <b>Cali Cartier Best Dog</b>. The
            mixing is pretty mid and I should probably redo it, but I love the
            idea on its own.

            This was my first attempt at making electronic music many years ago
            and is a silly, loop-based drum'n'bass track. It's not anything
            groundbreaking, but it was a good exercise to learn Ableton back in
            the day. I do remember having to Google how you Euro folk abbreviate
            kilometers per hour. I was dumber at the time... :)
