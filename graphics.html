        <p>
          I have been collecting .gifs from the Internet for many years, but my
          passion and collection increased tenfold once I discovered
          <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a> and the countless
          graphics sites that have been archived over the last couple of
          decades. <b>slugsludge</b> is a massive work-in-progress and labor of
          love. I have tens of thousands of .gifs that I have been actively
          sorting and organizing for many months. At my last measure, the
          complete collection sits around ~50,000, but only ~10% are on the site
          currently. <b class="italo">FYI</b> - A very small handful of these
          .gifs contain explicit content, so viewer be warned! <br /><br />
          <b>PRO TIP:</b> Hold CTRL on your keyboard while clicking any of the
          .gif files to open them in a new tab. If you want to harvest a whole
          folder, I would recommend using curl or a download manager.
