          I love to share my opinions on everything, especially music. My "tiny"
          music criticisms live here courtesy of my phone notes.

          On this page, you'll find a list of online articles that I've read and
          found especially interesting. I read a ton of shit every day, so
          you're only getting the cream of the crop here! I also make a point to
          archive each one using the
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>
          so that the links never die.

          <br />
          I know it seems like a funny Internet bit that I mention
          <b>God's favorite band</b>, Nickelback, so frequently on my website..
          but, again, I am so fr about it. Here is a review I wrote as a
          half-joke on the Ticketmaster official Nickelback band page. IIRC, I
          think the concert my wife and I went to was in September of 2023. The
          review is thrilling, to say the least. The link goes straight to the
          copy-pasted text from the review.. enjoy? lol
