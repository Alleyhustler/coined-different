            and live in my ancestral homeland, for which I am so grateful. My
            greatest loves in life are my smokin' hot wife, our three cats, the

            >, and the Internet. I am a lifelong computer whiz, both personally
            and professionally. My main hobbies are tinkering with software,
            creating art in many forms, and spending time in the great outdoors.
            I am an avid collector of "old" electronics and physical media like
            CDs, DVDs, VHS tapes, and cassettes. Finally, I am a self-proclaimed
            digital hoarder, and I self-host/maintain numerous archives on my
            personal servers.

            <b>Thank you for taking the time to read and dig this far.</b> I
            love making websites and fostering communal spaces online. I think
            everyone who is able should make one, even if just to have a little
            bit of fun. I'm not really a manifesto kinda guy, so I'll leave you
            with a little bit of my own vague wisdom:

            <b class="italo">Organizing and creating community</b> with others
            is far more valuable than any object in our digital and physical
            realms. The Internet is not meant to be so isolating and neither is
            the real world. It truly takes a village to make change and create a
            world that works for everybody. 🕯️🧙‍♀️🕯️
