        <h1>üìö Salty's Recent Reads üìö</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Below you'll find a list of articles that I've read and found
          especially interesting. I read a ton of shit of articles/documents
          online every day, so you're only getting the cream of the crop here! I
          also make a point to archive each one using the
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> so that the
          links never die.

            >"The 20 greatest jungle records ever made"</a
          >
          from a 2011 <b>FactMag</b> article. Pretty cool history throughout and
          all the tracks are sick. A good gateway into some stellar OG jungle
          artists and record labels.

          page on <b>Wikipedia</b> which was pretty much only used for illegal
          online activities until Meta sued them. I can't believe they got away
          with this for so long; the Internet is nuts.

            >"When Robots Got Muscles"</a
          >
          by <b>canmom</b>. This article traces the history of when modern art
          and media moved toward a tendency of depicting robots with a more
          organic and humanoid look. As an avid fan of cyberpunk media, this one
          really got me and is well-researched!

          >
          by <b>Paul Debevec</b>. This one's a quick journey through the early
          history of reflection mapping in CGI from the 1970s until the early
          1990s.
