          More shrines are coming soon, I swear... in the meantime, here are
          some works-in-progress and topic ideas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            👽 <b>Windows Media Player Skins</b> - These were so cool. I'm gonna
            make a shrine of my favorite ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            🪩 <b>Abba</b> -- only <i>the</i> greatest pop band of all time,
            homies.
          </li>
          <li>
            ⛓️ <b>Alice in Chains</b> -- only <i>the</i> best band of the grunge
            era.
          </li>
          <li>
            💻 <b>The Almighty Computer</b>
            <i>(and its related peripherals)</i> - Self-explanatory-ish.
          </li>
          <li>
            ⚡ <b>Fallout 1, 2, & Tactics</b> using sprites and tiles I've
            ripped from the old game files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strike>
            🎭 <b>The Sims (OG)</b> using archives of the Maxis site and rips
            from the game assets.
            </strike>
          </li>
          <li>
            🏹 <b>Mamamedia</b> - This was an early-Internet
            <i>(mid '90s-early '00s)</i> "edutainment" site that I absolutely
            loved when I was a little kid.
          </li>
          <li>
            💀 <b>Spooktacular Shrine</b> - At this point, I feel like it's a
            Neocities rite of passage to have a spooky shrine filled with
            Halloween .gifs.
          </li>
          <li>
            🛹 <b>A virtual skatepark</b> with cool old skate posters and ads,
            as well as all my collection of skateboarding .gifs. There are a
            lot!
          </li>
          <li>
            🛡️ <b>A medieval battlefield</b> <i>(a la 'Age of Empires')</i> full
            of knight .gifs bonking the shit out of each other with swords or
            whatever.
          </li>
          <li>
            ⚔️ <b>Runescape</b> - An ode to the culture and visual look present
            during Runescape's golden era in the early-to-mid 2000s. Yes, I'm
            old and no, I do not own a party hat.
          </li>
          <li>
            🍃 <b>Ms. Mary Jane</b> - This one might already be hidden on the
            site somewhere...
            <i>Hint: the link is hidden on every page in the same place.</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            👭 <b>Lesbians in pop culture</b> - A shrine to lesbian-coded
            characters in pop culture and modern media.
          </li>
          <li>
            🎸 <b>1960s Musicians</b> - A shrine to my favorite '60s musicians
            with a page design that uses/emulates accurate aesthetics from the
            era.
          </li>
        </ul>
