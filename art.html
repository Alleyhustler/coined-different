          <b>I love making art.</b> I think it's really important for us, as
          humans, to create art even if we don't perceive it as "good" or
          technically impressive. I mean, c'mon, we've been doodling on rocks
          for millenia. It's always been inside us, so you gotta let it out any
          way you can. <br /><br />
          <b>Anyways</b> - below you will find a list that details the various
          mediums I utilize to get out the silly ideas in my head.

        <a href="art_collage.html">Analog & Digital</a>
        <p>
          I enjoy making <b>digital & analog collages</b> using images mostly
          from my wife and I's collection of vintage magazines, whose topics
          vary widely. Most of our collection is '60s/'70s Playboys as well as
          late '90s-00s video game publications. The wife's most recent pickup
          was a bunch of late '70s issues of <b>"Farm Wife"</b> which is exactly
          the type of publication I'm all here for.
        </p>
        <br />
        <a href="art_html_collage.html">HTML</a>
        <p>
          I make <b>webpage collages</b> using HTML, absolute positioning, and
          minimal inline styling. I assemble them in VSCodium and retrieve
          static images and .gifs from my personal archives. These are
          definitely my favorite type of art to make.

        <p>
          Making <b>3D models and scenes</b> is a relatively new hobby for me. I
          haven't done too many projects because they are extremely time
          consuming and make my office hot, but I absolutely love Blender. What
          a sick ass program!

        <a href="art_digital_drawing.html">Digital Drawing</a>
        <p>
          I reluctantly drew these <b>digital drawings</b> in Procreate. This is
          a rough translation for,
          <i
            >"I bought my wife an iPad and now I feel financially obligated to
            use it every once in awhile, even though I hate drawing."</i
          >
          I also drew the fun Newgrounds-esque frame and other assets that you
          see on the website.

        <p>
          <b>"Esoteric Old Web Art"</b> that I've made using no modern software
          or tools. No Photoshop, no gimmicky bullshit. I scour for old games,
          shareware, and the like that allow you to create and save artwork from
          within them. Aesthetically, think
          <b class="italo">"Kidpix on psychedelics"</b> with a few caveats.

        <p>
          I have created and played music of all sorts for nearly two decades. I
          have been in a bunch of bands, but right now I'm only doing my own
          solo projects. I sometimes moonlight as a fill-in
          bassist/drummer/guitarist/whatever around my hometown. I don't
          necessarily play or write in one style; I like to switch it up as
          often as my budget and time allow. I also produce electronic music.

          You'll find a handful of one-off tracks I've recorded over the years
          at the link above. Enjoy. :)

          I don't have much on my Bandcamp because I deleted my old one.
          There'll be more here someday.

        <p>
          My previous band <i>(now defunct)</i> was called, <b>GOLD STAR</b>.
          The link above will take you to a Wayback Machine snapshot of the
          site; the domain name is no longer active. It looks super janky on the
          Wayback Machine for some reason, at least in my version of Firefox +
          Windows 11.. not sure if it'll look that way for you. It's actually
          the first site I ever coded myself and finished! I like to describe
          this project as some variation of "twangy Y2K fuzz rock." The project
          took a lot of influence from American proto-punk, Afrobeat guitar
          instrumentals, '60s country, and '90s alternative rock.
