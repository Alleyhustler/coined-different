          Whoever wrote this song was down bad for some skinny ass Diplo lookin'
          metrosexual.. üò© Don't get me wrong, the chorus of this song is not
          great by any means, but the verses alone merit this as an entry into
          the National Archives.

          <b>"How You Remind Me"</b> by Nickelback is the most ubiquitous song
          in English-speaking North America. It crosses borders, races, and
          social creeds; it <i>is</i> the handshake across the political aisle
          in the most tumultuous times. It's a palette cleanser of a song, and I
          say that so respectfully. This song is twenty years old and I know 75%
          of grown adults still know every word. I mean don't even mention, holy
          shit, the theme song for

          song. And it kinda rips harder? This shit was ahead of its time; 2013

          would be an absolutely perfect song if it weren't for that

          by NLE Choppa with a Lil Wayne feature. I just KNOW the 20-something
          meatheads at my local gym (who are probably gaslit into thinking
          working 80 hours per week is normal) listen to this song on repeat
          when they're trying to deadlift an unreasonable amount of weight for
          their <b>#fitstagram</b> accounts. No shade to NLE though, this song
          goes hard even if it's kinda goofy. And honestly, Lil Wayne's voice
          annoys the f*ck out of me, but his verse on this song is one of his
          best in recent years.

          <b class="date">01.28.2024</b> /// I don't get the '60s/'70s trend of
          fading songs out on an extended chorus. I think it's a total cop out.
          For example, Eddie Rabbitt's trucker anthem,
          <a href="https://youtu.be/Pu82VMf8enI?si=5oKN-7t_MODE2jfk"
            >"Drivin' My Life Away."</a
          >
          Like, don't get me wrong, <b>this song bangs</b>. However, why does it
          end on a fade out of the chorus? It could've ended the last chorus
          with a twangy, fuzzed-out riff and would've been way more memorable.
          This is one of my favorite eras of music, but this takes an automatic
          1 star off any song for me.
