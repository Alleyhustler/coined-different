        Below you'll find the <b class="italo">adoptables</b> that I've found in
        my travels on the web. I'll try to check for dead links every so often,
        but websites often die faster than I can check, so please let me know if
        a link breaks. Click any of the purple titles to travel to the site from
        which I obtained the adoptee(s).

          <b>///</b>
          I got these off of a personal website called
          <a
            class="glow-purple"
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121025100459/https://www.ailis.de/~k/apps/wlanims/"
            >K's Cluttered Loft</a
          >
          around ~2010 or so. These were definitely not intended to be
          adoptables, but I just thought they were cool. I was really into
          playing the original <b>Wasteland</b> game at the time
          <i>(the one from 1988 that inspired the Fallout series)</i>, and I
          remember loving the in-game sprite animations, but my dumb 11 year-old
          brain just couldn't figure out how to save them into .gifs. I didn't
          really understand the command line or Photoshop at this time, which
          was required to dump the animated assets from the game, so I turned to
          Google. This guy did some cool upscaling before a lot of people were
          educated on that sort of thing. Eventually, I'd like to house the full
          collection over on my <a href="graphics.html">graphics</a> page.

              I love these adoptables so much. They're so charming, and the
              color work is stunning! <b class="italo">ninacti0n</b> is one of
              my favorite personal websites of all time; their art style is
              wonderful, and they're an exceptionally talented musician as well!
              Definitely go check out their website.
